       <h1 class="blog">Where to begin?</h1>
        <p class="blog">There a lot of things which have to be considered during the entire web development process. Project plans, concepts, designs, development, testing and many more things. In this article we take a look at a variety of tips that help you managing your time more effectively. </p>


        <h1 class="blog">Manage distractions</h1>
        <p class="blog">Email, Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Slack, Whatsapp and so on. We’ve all been there and we all know how distracting these channels can be. Believe it or not, all these notifications shooting across your screens are giving you a hard time concentrating on the things which have to be done. </p>


        <h1 class="blog">2.8 seconds and you’re out</h1>
        <p class="blog">A conducted study by Erik Altmann at the Michigan State University found out that a distraction lasting 2.8 seconds already leads to an 100% increase of your errors. This means that even a short distraction leads to a massive increase in your errors. </p>


        <h1 class="blog">Put yourself on productivity time</h1>
        <p class="blog">Managing your distractions also means managing your social interaction with friends and co-workers. Being regularly distracted by co-workers of course, influences your productivity. It doesn’t mean that you should bury yourself from social interactions. However we recommend giving your co-workers friendly signals when you’re approachable and when you’re not.</p>
